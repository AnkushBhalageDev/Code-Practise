1. Palindrome Check

Question:
Write a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards).

Sample Input:

String: beeb


Sample Output:

beeb
String is palindrome

Binary Search in Sorted Array

2.Question:
Given a sorted integer array, implement binary search to find the index of a target element.

Sample Input:

Array: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
Target: 7


Sample Output:

Mid : 5

3.Two Sum (Target Sum Indices)

Question:
Given an array of integers and a target sum, return indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

Sample Input:

Array: [2,3,6,7,9,11]
TargetSum: 9


Sample Output:

indices  2   0


(a) Find the first non-repeated character in a string
Input: My nam is
Output: M

(b) Find the immediate lowest and highest value from a list compared to a given number
Input:

List: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Number: 8


Output:

Immediate High : 9 Immediate Low :7


(c) Count frequency of numbers in a list (only duplicates)
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,98,7,8,0,10,10]
Output:

8 2
10 2


(d) Filter strings containing ‘K’
Input: ["Kartik","Singh","KarGar"]
Output:

Kartik
KarGar


(e) Convert each string to uppercase
Input: ["Kartik","KarSingh","Gaurav"]
Output:

[KARTIK, KARSINGH, GAURAV]


(f) Find the maximum repeated value in a list
Input: [1,2,3,5,6,98,6,7,9,9,98,98]
Output: 98

(g) Reverse the words of a string
Input: "My name is"
Output: "is name My"

(h) Find the first three and last three numbers of a list
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Output:

First 3 :[1, 2, 3] Last 3:[8, 9, 10]


(i) Count duplicate characters in a string
Input: "kartik"
Output: (if any duplicates)

(j) Find numbers starting with ‘2’
Input: [1,22,20,25,30,35]
Output: [22, 20, 25]

(k) Find missing elements from 1 to N
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10]
Output: 7

(l) Group strings by starting character
Input: ["Kartik","KarSingh","Gaurav"]
Output:

{K=[Kartik, KarSingh], G=[Gaurav]}


(m) Find palindrome strings from a list
Input: ["level","beeb","kartik"]
Output: [level, beeb]

(n) Sort strings by their length
Input: ["Kartik","Gaurav","Ram","KarSingh"]
Output: [Ram, Kartik, Gaurav, KarSingh]

(o) Find second highest number
Input: [5,9,11,2,8]
Output: 9

(p) Group anagrams together
Input: ["cat","act","tea","eat"]
Output:

{act=[cat, act], aet=[tea, eat]}


(q) Toggle string case
Input: "AnKusH"
Output: "aNkUSh"

(r) Count repeated words in a string
Input: "My name is is"
Output:

My 1
name 1
is 2


(s) Square numbers divisible by 3 and leave others as is
Input: [2,4,6,8,2,10,4,12,6]
Output: 2,4,36,8,2,10,4,144,36
